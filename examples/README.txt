## sqlc.rb

A sql client using tabbedpanes.

Enter an sql query in the textbox. Click Run.

Or Press Enter on the name of a table in the tables listing. Its
contents will be shown in a new tab in the tabbedpane.

Or Press Space on a table. Its columns are shown below. Now select
columns and then click Construct. Selected columns will be used to
construct a query. Press Run to execute it.

If you are inside a table, use Alt-TAb to exit.

## sqlm.rb

Identical to sqlc.rb. This demo uses a multi-container for multiple
resultsets instead of a tabbedpane.
