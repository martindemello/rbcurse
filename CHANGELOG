## Overhaul of tabbedpane

Simplified, and it more or less completely makes sense now.
A component may be added directly without creating a form
which allows the TP to set row, col, and height width.

At this moment, it no longer creates a form automatically, you have to call
tp.form(tab) to get a form associated with the tab. Check code for latest on
this. Or check samples: testtpane.rb and testtpane2.rb.

## RFED16 new simplified buffering

Major changes. Most widgets redone (buffer part).
Containers majorly done. Table and TabbedPane still pending.

**2009-11-03 23:30**
## tabbedpanes ##

Now on first click of tabbed button, form is painted.
A form.repaint for the lower form was required.

## some progress on tabbedpanes ##

Ugly hacking and I really haven't a clue what's happening
since there's internal forms working.
Anyhow, its now showing up, can see form cursor moving.
Does not show up immediately, have to press key several times for form to display.

## splitpane and scrollpane working ##

Both are working. Changes to copywin had caused issues. And printborder.
Decreasing comp width does not reduce pad size, but pad keeps printing larger size.
So in Splitpane it was overwriting. Now in Pad we maintain sheight as comp's height.
Major change in pad, but hope it works and doesn't bomb out somewhere.

## Making changes for 1.9 and testing ##

Mostly key related changes.
However, there could be some string index change lurking around

** 2009-02-22 20:48 **

## Released 0.1.2 ##

- search in textview with wrap, case insensitive, highlighting searched text
- table can have nil data
- tabbed pane has ok_cancel button, ok by default
- table autosizing - required for adhoc queries
- table horizontal scrolling
- editing when more columns than viewable in table
- confirm dialog, normal mnemonics for buttons

## Code to stop table from printing a column if exceeding bounds ##

Uploaded to github, will be included in 0.1.2.

EXPERIMENTAL CODE: Affects only tables. Now table will not print a column or header
if columns width causes it to exceed width of table.

This means if you have a single column which is wider than table
then it wont print. In Listboxes we always truncate data and pass to
renderer. We could do that here, but it could get messy.

* * *
**2009-02-12 **
## Missed one parameter in Table's repaint, and some Table Cell Renderers

Fixed and uploaded as 0.1.1

## Table Changed Event ##

One may either trap the CHANGED event of a component OR
a TABLE_EDITING_EVENT which gives us previous and new values, previous row and col.
This will fire for each cell exited, and on editing stopped (if a user presses ENTER after editing).

One example would be to set a date_modified if any column of a row changes. 

Also am firing CHANGED from table for its cells.

## firing property change and others ##

Some major changes (internal)

1.   In order not to repaint the entire form each time, we must only repaint a widget when modified.
     However, as can be seen, widgets are being modified by other widgets. Thus whenever a property
     is changed, we need a flag to be set that repainting is required.

    Thus, copied dsl_accessor and made dsl_property. Whenever, such props are modified, a property 
    change is now fired, and repaint_required is set to true.
    I am currently changing this. What this means is that on startup, fire_prop_change will be called
    many times, and i need to avoid this on first time instantiation. TODO.
    
2. The tricky part was text_variables. When there value changes any widget (such as label) auto
   changes. When a text_variable is defined for  field, internally that field, adds itself as a 
   dependent. When its value is changed, it fires a change to the dependent field.

3. The real worrisome part was this:
   When user passes in a hash in the constructor, i was directly setting variables, NOT calling
   methods. Tracked this down. Now i am calling methods and not setting variables. See rwidget.rb
   instance_variable_set (top). Only throrough testing will tell how much this change
   will affect stuff. Maybe not.

## Field storing datatypes ##

1.   set_buffer updates datatype of data
2.   get_value reverts to original datatype (stored as a string since many methods
     do check length etc

Widget binds_keys
Certain widgets like tables etc would like to bind_keys which could be used by other
widgets. Such as left and right keys or del key. So these should not be at the program
level, but only at widget level.

## Boolean buttons use "variable" not "text_variable" ##

That was a misunderstanding. Checkbutton, Toggle and Radio use "variable" which 
updates or gets updated by any changes.

frmincr200901011300.tgz
* * *
**2008-12-31 23:46**
## Variable modifications ##

Had to move to get_value and set_value so that Variable could support a hash or array without
anything else changing.
That means if a set of checkboxes and radio buttons are based on one Variable which is a Hash,
they will continue working as before, since they always pass t heir name as a second parm to set_value 
(whch is used as a key, if Variable is a hash).
Earlier i was using value= but that does not allow 2 params.
In the case of a hash, even retrieving requires the widgt name as key.
So seeing how many params are coming in does not work. Thus moving from value() and value= to get and set value.

Currently, its there as RVariable. Will be moved to Variable in a day or so.

## sqlpopup and keymapper ##


We have a much simpler than VER keymapper. Code is small. 
      - Uses keyboard.rb from VER project to give us ESC and meta/alt keys.
      - We use same syntax for configuring such as class.let :mode do etc.
      - Provided:
               - single keys combinations
               - a mode with its set of keys
               - dual keys such as C-x C-c or C-x p etc which do not change mode.

frmincr200811120036.tgz
* * *
**2008-11-11 23:40**
## sqlpopup our own modes and key ##

allows cx mode with its keys
but its looks okay for a mode
for a multiple key we would prefer to say : C-c C-x
and not create a separate context./mode.

SIMPLE view has column name and data per row.
ALTERNATING has name followed by data in next row.
TABULAR gives the entire result in one tabular form
TABULAR implements a search using "/" and ^N and ^P to go back/forth in search.

      or datasource to check for an existing name
      i.e. reduce coupling.

Still many errors de to references from form to app.

Totally unclear here as to what the app is doing, and should it have all thefunctinolity
in it or not. Too much calling from form to app.

Its quite a mess and needs a major overhaul.

I also need to make changes so that rt_hashes and rt_fields dont have to be passed.

Application should only have what is required by the main app for setting up and cleaning ==
not all the stuff for regular work. 

Form should contain all else.

1.  Got the menu program working after all the changes in base classes.

2. Got programs running from menu. Apparently, some panels were not being

3. There was a warning of BOTTOM_WIN_WIDTH already defined that was messing the screen
   and i could not see it clearly, so it bugged me a long time.

All's okay but the skel programs have to be updated. The menu DSL minp1 has to be rerun to see
if it gives correct output as per menu1.rb.
Basically, panels have to be returned with windows so they can be destroyed.

Made a class out of it

## form specific key labels - wip ##

It is working but not standard
Need to simplify it.
qapp returns keylabels but does not support a keys_handled
tapp has keyhasharray but does not generate its labels.
we should junk app labels. that complicates things.

## tab and enter behaviour in query apps ##

Tab moves between fields in query form
Tab in table moves back to query form.
Enter in table runs query as b4, but now also moves focus to table

## panelreader ##
deleting panel in ensure otherwise previous screen wuld be scr00d.

## help ##
Added a generic application_key_handler in Application.rb which shows
page specific help. Currently, i have to work that out. Application should
define a page. It by default pops up TODO !

More polishing on panelreader.rb
But cannot get the line numbers correct.
Also if I display line # on top, then cursor remains there.
If i put the print statemnet at beg of loop, the line number is wonky.
It is correct at end of loop, but then the cursor is stuck on top.

## handling of cursor and selection in subseq queries ##

especially if:
  
  *  fewer queries returned in second query
  *  no queries returned in second query

  Now cursor will always be in row one after a fresh query when you tab.
  Can't tab in if no rows.

## get_curr_index bug ##

this was returning one more (base 1) so some users were doing -1
Some methods were getting wrong curr_item like the handle_? methods.

User cannot tab into table if no data.

Issue of wrong header count if no rows also fixed.
